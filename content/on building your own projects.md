I am currently in the middle of my Computer Science degree. While I am not happy knowing that I spent a lot of money on tuition, I am more saddened by the fact that I cannot build anything of substance. 
As a fact, the study of computer science should be more aptly named the study of **computation** instead. Calling it computer science is like calling astronomy telescope science. 
I spent the last semester studying math and computation, and while I did know how a Turing machine works, it didn't seem like much and I constantly felt like I am not doing enough.
I attribute my state of dread to those reasons:
1. Computation theory is a different skill from coding and making functional software.
2. The skills needed for an internship is thus, vastly different from what is taught at school, and the student is expected to pick it up on their free time on top of an already full-time school schedule.

The ultimate solution for this is, as said by many people on YouTube with alleged experience, building your own project (and many would happily share their own project so you can copy from). The matter is, I do not feel like I learn anything that matters to me when I copy those projects which are supposed to impress employers. And for the things I might want to build, I have zero ideas how. Heck, I don't even know how a program would look like.

So here's my own theory on how to build something (tech job version - general version later):
- Start with a really, really simple thing. But it has to be your thing. Don't write another file organizer Python script. Observe your online life, the apps you use, the websites you visit, and see if there is any simple tool that makes just one thing better.
- Open source is cool, because you see how things work. Fork, clone, study. Comment as you go. Do not worry about making contributions yet.
- Don't do web frameworks. It's just overdone now tbh. Unless you want to be a web dev, then actually go study design and art too.
- (Actually, study art when you are free. Art is an immensely cool hobby.)
- Study what you need. 
- Test, test, test, repeat. Learn debugging.
- Keep documentation websites handy.
- Get a large computer monitor. Laptop screens suck.
- Tutorials are always a risky move. I am currently looking for a better method to learn things. Maybe studying open source code?
