In order to create magic, one must be physically and mentally ready. Here are the 5 fundamentals to an effective magic practitioner.
1. Sleep
- Sleep before midnight, ideally 10pm. An hour before midnight is worth 2 after midnight.
- "making up for lost sleep" does not work. The real Restorative Effective Magic (REM) period of sleep is in the 7th-8th hour of your sleeping time. Sleeping less hours simply makes many things worse - you restore less energy, your memory is worse, you cannot focus during the day, your metabolism gets screwed over, etc,...
- it is notable that nighttime activities, especially virtual, are enticing because many of us are not used to being alone and silent in our minds for the brief period before unconsciousness. to sleep well and early means accepting that you are going to miss out on those, and will catch up with the fun stuff in the morning, **and that is alright**.
- remember : you are in control over your own time. be aware of everything to lose (nighttime activities) and to gain (exp & mana boost), and the damages of staying up late repeatedly, and make an intentional, conscious choice. that way you won't regret whatever you choose to do in the next morning.

2. Physical Status

first, some thoughts about [[physical health]].
keep your physical stats in balance, unless you need to specialize in some sport/bodybuilding.
- Strength: weightlifting is the key here. See: [[strength training]].
- Agility: for stamina, [[cardio]] is best, my favorite is uphill walks. another to keep while doing strength training is [[flexibility]].
- Endurance: this covers many aspects: muscle endurance, joints and bone health.

i also note about [[nutrients]] here.

3. Mental Preparations

(some thoughts about [[mental health]] here.)
- keep your information sources simple and functional.
	- what do you need in a day? mail, entertainment, some news of **things you care about** (not any random news), things you want to read, things to learn/study, etc.
	- answer those, and you will keep a mental space clear from people who wants to invade it for their own benefits.
- let the tools you use have a clear purpose.
	- i use YT as a personal library, with some entertainment, so I only collect useful references and guides. **what you see the first moment you open up a tool, defines how you use it and your experience onwards**. first impressions are important, and i think we all know that, so we shall use it to our advantage. some [[youtube & web tips]] here.
- time of the day is important.
	- the best ideas come from your dreams, and retain for only a few minutes right after you wake up, unspoiled by any other external information. if you relate to this, the plan is clear - practice first thing after you wake up. of course, before that there is a [[morning routine]] to get ready too.
- write things down.
	- what you are reading is proof i am practicing it.
	- ideas are fleeting, and you cannot keep any of them for more than a moment. write them all down, and know that [[there's no bad idea]].
